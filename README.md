***This repository named 'josefoviedo.github.io' is the main source for all the code and files I want to be public regarding my own personal data analytics portfolio, where I only use simulated or open data for my projects and never any sort of private/sensative data. It includes things like this README file which is sort of my repository landing page with links to view my personal website, data analysis projects, social media, etc.***
